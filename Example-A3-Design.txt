Algorithm Design Document
Make a copy before you begin (File -> Make a copy). Add the Assignment # above and complete the sections below BEFORE you begin to code. The sections will expand as you type. When you are finished, download this document as a PDF (File -> Download -> PDF) and submit it to D2L.
This document contains an interactive checklist. To mark an item as complete, click on the box.
Planning your program before you start coding is part of the development process. In this document, you will:
* Step 1: Write a detailed description of your program, at least two complete sentences
* Step 2: If applicable, design a sample run with test input and output
* Step 3: Algorithm design
   * Identify the program inputs and their data types
   * Identify the program outputs and their data types
   * Identify any calculations or formulas needed
   * Write the algorithmic steps as pseudocode or a flowchart. Look at the Pseudocode syntax at the bottom of this document. Tools for flowchart - Draw.io - Diagrams.net
1. Program Description
In the box below, describe the purpose of the program. You must include a detailed description with at least two complete sentences.
Program description:
	

	2. Sample Run
If you are designing your own program, you will start with a sample run. Imagine a user is running your program - what will they see? What inputs do you expect, and what will be the outputs from the given inputs? Choose test data you will use to test your program. Calculate and show the expected outputs. Use the sample run to test your program. 
Sample run:
	

	3. Algorithmic Design
Before you begin coding, you must first plan out the logic and think about what data you will use to test your program for correctness. All programmers plan before coding - this saves a lot of time and frustration! Use the steps below to identify the inputs and outputs, calculations, and steps needed to solve the problem.
Use the pseudocode syntax shown in the document, supplemented with English phrases if necessary.  Do not include any implementation details (e.g. source code file names, or language syntax).  Do not include any Python specific syntax or data types. 
Algorithmic design:
1. Identify and list all of the user input and their data types. Include a variable name, data type, and description.  Simple data types include string, integer, floating point, (single) character, and boolean. Complex Data structures like lists should be referenced by name, e.g. “array of integer” or “array of string”.
name STRING
year STRING
city STRING
event STRING

option STRING

2. Identify and list all of the user output and their data types. Include a variable name, data type, and description.   Data types include string, integer, floating point, (single) character, and boolean.  Complex Data structures like lists should be referenced by name, e.g. “array of integer” or “array of string”.
most_occuring_name
min_year
max_year

3. What calculations do you need to do to transform inputs into outputs?  List all formulas needed, if applicable. If there are no calculations needed, state there are no calculations for this algorithm.If there are no calculations needed, state there are no calculations for this algorithm. Formulae should reference the variable names from step a and step b as applicable.


4. Design the logic of your program using pseudocode or flowcharts. Here is where you would use conditionals, loops, or functions (if applicable) and list the steps in transforming inputs into outputs. Walk through your logic steps with the test data from the assignment document or the sample run above. Use the syntax shown at the bottom of this document and plain English phrases.  Do not include any implementation details (e.g. file names) or Python or any language specific syntax.
MESSAGE "WELCOME"

Repeat until quit:
	PROMPT "Select an option"
			"[1] Most occuring name"
			"[2] Min Year"
			"[3] Max Year"
			"[9] Quit"

	INPUT option

	Do option calculations

	Display Data Result

MESSAGE "Goodbye"

	

Pseudocode Syntax
Think about each step in your algorithm as an action and use the verbs below:
To do this:
	Use this verb:
	Example:
	Create a variable
	DECLARE
	DECLARE integer num_dogs
	Print to the console window
	DISPLAY
	DISPLAY “Hello!”
	Read input from the user into a variable
	INPUT  
	INPUT num_dogs
	Update the contents of a variable
	SET
	SET num_dogs = num_dogs + 1
	Conditionals
	Use a single alternative conditional
	IF condition THEN
     statement
     statement
END IF
	IF num_dogs > 10 THEN
     DISPLAY “That is a lot of dogs!”
END IF
	Use a dual alternative conditional
	IF condition THEN
     statement
     statement
ELSE
     statement
     statement
END IF
	IF num_dogs > 10 THEN
     DISPLAY “You have more than 10 dogs!”
ELSE
     DISPLAY “You have ten or fewer dogs!”
END IF
	Use a switch/case statement
	SELECT variable or expression
   CASE value_1:
      statement
      statement
   CASE value_2:
      statement
      statement
   CASE value_2:
      statement
      statement
   DEFAULT:
      statement
      statement
END SELECT
	SELECT num_dogs
   CASE 0: DISPLAY “No dogs!”
   CASE 1: DISPLAY “One dog..”
   CASE 2: DISPLAY “Two dogs..”
   CASE 3: DISPLAY “Three dogs..”
   DEFAULT: DISPLAY “Lots of dogs!”
END SELECT
	Loops
	Loop while a condition is true - the loop body will execute 0 or more times.
	WHILE condition
   statement
   statement
END WHILE
	SET num_dogs = 1
WHILE num_dogs < 10
   DISPLAY num_dogs, “ dogs!”
   SET num_dogs = num_dogs + 1
END WHILE
	Loop while a condition is true - the loop body will execute 1 or more times.
	DO 
   statement
   statement
WHILE condition
	SET num_dogs = 1
DO 
   DISPLAY num_dogs, “ dogs!”
   SET num_dogs = num_dogs + 1
WHILE num_dogs < 10
	Loop a specific number of times.
	FOR counter = start TO end 
   statement
   statement
END FOR
	FOR count = 1 TO 10
   DISPLAY num_dogs, “ dogs!”
END FOR
	Functions
	Create a function
	FUNCTION return_type name (parameters)
   statement

   SET sum = num1 + num2
   RETURN sum

	CALL function_name
	CALL add(2, 3)
